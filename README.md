# Bee-Bee-Gone
A C# Unity-based remake of the classic GTA:SA arcade game "Let's get ready to Bumble!". (https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Let%27s_Get_Ready_to_Bumble)

The project features:
* Easy entity creation/duplication for level editing.
* Simple arcade-game rules and feedback.
* Scoring / Lives feedback.

The project intends to feature:
* 120 finished A-levels.
* Leaderboards (Local and Global).
* iFrame <-> game events for website embedding.

## Usage
The project is directly to be packaged and built for the SA-RP GTA:V community mod. (https://www.sa-rp.com).
To run, upload the packaged html files to a webserver and open it via the url to the file.

## Contribution
Currently looking for people to assist in level creation as 120 levels takes a toll!
